# Human-pose-estimation
Human pose estimation is a computer vision technique that identifies the spatial arrangement of body parts in images or videos. It is crucial for applications like fitness tracking, gesture recognition, and augmented reality. Using deep learning models, such as those from the MediaPipe library, it detects key body joints to form a skeletal structure. This technology is valuable in healthcare for rehabilitation, retail for customer analytics, and autonomous vehicles for driver monitoring. However, it faces challenges like accuracy limitations due to environmental factors, privacy concerns, and the need for robust models that generalize across diverse populations and scenarios.
